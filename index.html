				<p>Welcome.</p>
				<p>My name is Jos&eacute; Pedro Aniceto and I graduated in Chemical Engineering in 2010 at Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP). Since then I have worked as a researcher of Associate Laboratory CICECO, University of Aveiro, where my research activities have been focused in separation processes, namely ion exchange and chromatographic processes.</p>
				<p>In my time as a researcher I have authored or co-authored 8 scientific papers, 2 book chapters, and participated in 3 international conferences. Head on to the <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> section for more information.</p>
				<p>I am currently working on my Ph.D. thesis on the isolation and purification of bio-active compounds from biomass residues using simulated moving bed chromatography. These molecules have high commercial value, especially within the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetical industries, but are difficult to separate thus requiring advanced separation techniques.</p>
				<p>If you would like to know more about the research being conducted in our research group, EgiChem, head to our website at <a href="http://www.egichem.com/">egichem.com</a>.</p>
				<p>You can also check the CICECO (Center for Research in Ceramics and Composite) webpage at <a href="http://www.ciceco.ua.pt/index.php?language=pt">ciceco.ua.pt</a>.</p>
				<p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p>
